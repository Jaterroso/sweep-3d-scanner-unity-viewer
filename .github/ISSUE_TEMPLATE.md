This form is intended mainly for bug reports and feature requests. 
This is NOT the place to ask for general project help.

Tips for posting an issue:
    Describe the bug or feature request in detail. 
    Explain what happened and what you expected to happen.
    If relevant, a code snippet, screenshot, or small-test can help people understand.
